## CMCommerce

This is a fake static E-commerce site for selling phones

## What I learn from this project

* How to use react hooks (for a first real project)
* How to use `fetch` as a hook to get data from a Rest API that is set up on Heroku
* How to deploy to Netlify using both the `netlify-cli` manually and using a Github CD setup
